Steamify is a Google Chrome extension that displays user stats from FACEIT.com on their Steam profile. Therefore it may be used as a shortcut to find more information quickly on the users FACEIT stats without having to go over to the platform.

Extensions shows data as:
	- Level
	- ELO
	- Subscription type
	- W/L statistic of the 20 last games
	- Matches played
	- Winrate
	- HS avg
	- K/D ratio
	- Current streak
	- Longest streak
	- Stats of all maps
		- Overall K/D
		- Winrate

It works on any Steam profile, doesn't matter if it is private or not, as far as the Steam profile has been connected to FACEIT account, it will show data. 

Is pretty useful if you want to understand how good the player is before adding him or easily find out if the player is smurf or not.
