# steamify

Steamify is a Chrome extension that enhances the experience on steamcommunity.com with faceit.com.

It works on any Steam profile, doesn't matter if it is private or not, as far as the Steam profile has been connected to FACEIT account, it will show data.
Is pretty useful if you want to understand how good the player is before adding him or easily find out if the player is smurf or not.
This extension will replace all similar online-services.

NOTE: Steamify is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with Steam or FACEIT.
